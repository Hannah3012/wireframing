## What is wireframing ?

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

## Key Elements of Wireframing
- **Layout Structure**: Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.

  **Example**:
   - A typical blog layout might include a header at the top, main content in the center, a sidebar on the right for recent posts or ads, and a footer with contact info.
   - This structure helps users quickly locate the type of content they're looking for.

- **Navigation**: Shows how users will move through the site or application.

  **Example**:
   - A top navigation bar with links to "Home," "About," "Services," and "Contact."
   - This enables users to access core pages easily from anywhere on the site.

- **Content Placement**: Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.

  **Example**:
    - A landing page with a hero section featuring a headline, subtext, and a prominent "Sign Up"button in the center.
    - This directs user focus to conversion.
    
- **Functionalit**y: Outlines key functionalities and interactions.

  **Example**:
    - A wireframe of a contact form with input fields for name and email, a dropdown for inquiry type, and a "Submit" button.
    - Even without design, itâ€™s clear how the user is expected to interact with it.
 
## Types of Wireframes
  - ### Low-Fidelity Wireframes:
    Simple sketches or basic digital layouts focusing on overall structure and functionality without     detailed design.

    **They are typically used**:
     - Early in the design process (concept development)
     - During team brainstorming
     - When validating layout and flow

  - ### High-Fidelity Wireframes:
    More detailed and refined versions, often closer to the final design, including more specific        layout and design elements.

    **They are typically used**:
     - Later in the design process (refinement and pre-development stages)
     - During usability testing
     - When handing off designs to developers
